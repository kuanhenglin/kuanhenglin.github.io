> Awarded **Blockchain for Society 2nd Place** (sponsored by Jump Crypto) as an entry for [**HackMIT 2022**](https://archive.hackmit.org/2022/). We use users' YouTube watch history and match them with those with similar media interests via LLM and large CV model embeddings. Particularly, we visualize user interest overlap (and divergence) with **video clouds** (embedding PCA point clouds) to reveal similar interests while preserving privacy (i.e., without revealing users' YouTube histories).
