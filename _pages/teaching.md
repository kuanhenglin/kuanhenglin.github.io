### AI Reading Group

I am a founder and ex-organizer of the [AI Reading Group](https://bit.ly/acm_ai_23_24_reading_cluster), a bi-weekly meeting of officers and general members to discuss current important areas of machine learning research. We have covered a wide range of topics such as diffusion models, reinforcement learning, climate AI, quantum ML, federated learning attacks & defenses, audio ML, ML engineering, with many more to come!

I recently led an AI Reading Group session myself on "Generative Models, 'AI Art," and Beyond" where I introduced the landscape of generative vision, layed the foundation for diffusion models, explained text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion, and presented subsequent works on controllable generation, video generation, 3D generation, distillation, and more.
