Hello! My name is **Kuan Heng (Jordan) Lin**, and I am a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at UCLA with a minor in Mathematics, working with Professor [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) on computer vision and generative AI.

My research interests stem from **generative AI** to topics such as computer vision, multimodal/3D generation, controllable generation, generative vision for autonomy, and foundation & world models. Particularly, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries and applications of large generative models to allow us to interact with them in a more **human** way.

I am previously a Research Intern at [Snap's](https://research.snap.com/) [Creative Vision](https://research.snap.com/team/category/creative-vision.html) team, where I worked on large-scale video diffusion models (Snap Video V2) with [Willi Menapace](https://www.willimenapace.com/), particularly building Snap's first 2D (Data + Model) Parallel framework and implementing variable-length multimodal training. I am also passionate about CS and ML education: I am part of the Program Development Team at the [UCLA Learning Assistant Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/), and I am an Advisor and Ex-President of [ACM AI @ UCLA](https://ai.uclaacm.com).

I also do :camera: [photography](https://www.instagram.com/nine_egg/) and :movie_camera: [filmmaking](https://jordanlin.notion.site/Film-Portfolio-15b72433ba87805ea223f2c62216d4db).

**My name:** 林宽恒 (lín kuān héng), hence my legal name <b>Kuan Heng Lin</b>.
