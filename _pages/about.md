Hello! My name is **Kuan Heng (Jordan) Lin**, and I am a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at UCLA with a minor in Mathematics, working in Professor [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/)'s lab on computer vision and generative AI.

My research interests stem from **generative AI** to topics such as computer vision, interpretability, image processing, biomedical imaging, optimization, and natural language processing. Particularly, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries and applications of large text-to-image (T2I) models like Stable Diffusion with relatively training-free methods.

I am the Co-President of ACM AI @ UCLA (2023--2024), and I am part of the Program Development Team at the UCLA Learning Assistant Program.

**My name:** 林宽恒 (lín kuān héng), hence my legal name <b>Kuan Heng Lin</b>
