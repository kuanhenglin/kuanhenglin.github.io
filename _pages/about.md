Hello! My name is **Kuan Heng (Jordan) Lin**, and I am a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at UCLA with a minor in Mathematics, working with Professor [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) on computer vision and generative AI.

My research interests stem from **generative AI** to topics such as computer vision, interpretability, image processing, biomedical imaging, optimization, and natural language processing. Particularly, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries and applications of large text-to-image (T2I) models like Stable Diffusion with training-free methods.

I am an incoming Research Intern at [Snap's](https://research.snap.com/) [Creative Vision](https://research.snap.com/team/category/creative-vision.html) team, where I will be working on optimizing training and inference of large video generation models, mentored by [Willi Menapace](https://www.willimenapace.com/). I am also part of the Program Development Team at the [UCLA Learning Assistant Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/), and I am an Advisor and Ex-Co-President of [ACM AI @ UCLA](https://ai.uclaacm.com).

**My name:** 林宽恒 (lín kuān héng), hence my legal name <b>Kuan Heng Lin</b>.
