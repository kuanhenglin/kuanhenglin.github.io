Hello! My name is **Kuan Heng (Jordan) Lin**, and I am a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at UCLA with a minor in Mathematics, working with Professor [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) on computer vision and generative AI.

My research interests stem from **generative AI** to topics such as computer vision, multimodal generation, controllable generation, interpretability, image processing, biomedical imaging, and optimization. Particularly, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries and applications of large generative models to allow us to interact with them in a more **human** way.

I am previously a Research Intern at [Snap's](https://research.snap.com/) [Creative Vision](https://research.snap.com/team/category/creative-vision.html) team, where I worked on large-scale video diffusion models (SnapVideo V2) with [Willi Menapace](https://www.willimenapace.com/), particularly building Snap's first Model Parallel framework and implementing variable-length multimodal training. I am also part of the Program Development Team at the [UCLA Learning Assistant Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/), and I am an Advisor and Ex-Co-President of [ACM AI @ UCLA](https://ai.uclaacm.com).

**My name:** 林宽恒 (lín kuān héng), hence my legal name <b>Kuan Heng Lin</b>.
