Hello! My name is **Kuan Heng (Jordan) Lin**, and I am a first-year PhD student at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Aleksander Hołyński](https://holynski.org/) and [Micah Goldblum](https://goldblum.github.io/). I am interested in understanding and controlling multimodal generative models to allows to interact with them in a more **human** way.

I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics, during which I had a great time working with [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) on controllable image generation.

I was a research intern at [Netflix Eyeline Studios](https://www.eyelinestudios.com/), where I worked on controllable video generation with [Ning Yu](https://ningyu1991.github.io/). I was also a research engineering intern at [Snap's](https://research.snap.com/) [Creative Vision](https://research.snap.com/team/category/creative-vision.html) team, where I worked on 2D parallelism for scaling up video diffusion model training (Snap Video V2) with [Willi Menapace](https://www.willimenapace.com/).

I am also passionate about CS and ML education: I was part of the Program Development Team at the [UCLA Learning Assistant Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/), and I was an Advisor and Ex-President of [ACM AI @ UCLA](https://ai.uclaacm.com).

I do :camera: [photography](https://www.instagram.com/nine_egg/) and :movie_camera: [filmmaking](https://jordanlin.notion.site/Film-Portfolio-15b72433ba87805ea223f2c62216d4db).

**My name:** 林宽恒 (lín kuān héng), hence my legal name <b>Kuan Heng Lin</b>.
