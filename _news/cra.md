I was selected as a finalist for the [2024&ndash;25 CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/crae/awards/cra-outstanding-undergraduate-researchers/) :D I want to thank [UCLA CS](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) for nominating me, and [Sicheng Mo](https://sichengmo.github.io/) and Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) for all the mentorship along the way!
